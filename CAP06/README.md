# **Java Programming Solutions and Fundamentals of Array Structures**

This repository contains solutions to a series of programming problems in Java. Each problem is presented with a brief description of its functionality, along with a direct link to the corresponding code.

This chapter focuses on **array structures**, a fundamental concept in programming used to store and manipulate collections of data efficiently. It introduces the key concepts of arrays, including **single-dimensional arrays**, used to manage linear data collections, and **multi-dimensional arrays**, used for tabular or matrix-like data. The chapter explains array initialization, element access, iteration using loops, and common operations such as sorting, searching, and merging arrays.
