# **Java Programming Solutions and Fundamentals of Modularization**

This repository contains solutions to a series of programming problems in Java. Each problem is presented with a brief description of its functionality, along with a direct link to the corresponding code.

This chapter focuses on **modularization** through the use of **subroutines**, an essential concept in programming that promotes code reusability, readability, and maintainability. It introduces two main types of subroutines: **functions**, which return values after performing a specific task, and **procedures (methods)**, which perform actions without returning a value. The chapter explains how to define, call, and organize subroutines, emphasizing the use of **parameters** for passing data and **return statements** for producing results.
